# Documentation

track-dev-time is a comprehensive tool designed to automatically track your development sessions and provide insightful analytics via a powerful SaaS dashboard.

## Introduction

track-dev-time combines a seamless CLI experience with a cloud-based dashboard to help developers monitor their coding habits effortlessly.

- **Automatic Session Tracking:** As soon as you start your development environment (e.g., `npm run dev`), the CLI automatically tracks your coding sessions without any manual input.
- **Smart Session Management:** It handles starting, pausing, and stopping sessions based on your development workflow.
- **Data Synchronization & Analytics:** Session data is saved locally and synchronized with the SaaS platform, where you can view detailed statistics, trends, and motivational insights to improve your productivity.

This tool is ideal for developers looking to understand how they spend their time coding, identify productivity patterns, and stay motivated through personalized goals and analytics.

## Features

- Automatic session tracking on dev server start
- Intelligent session pause/resume management
- Local JSON session storage with automatic sync to SaaS
- Secure API key authentication
- Cross-project synchronization
- Dashboard with insights, trends, and motivational goals

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- An active internet connection to sync data with the SaaS dashboard

### Installing the CLI

You can install **track-dev-time** using any of the following package managers:

**npm**

```bash
  npm install track-dev-time --save-dev
```

**pnpm**

```bash
  pnpm add -D track-dev-time
```

**yarn**

```bash
  yarn add track-dev-time --dev
```

### Setup

Once installed, run the setup command to automatically configure your project:

**npm**

```bash
  npx track-dev-time setup
```

**pnpm**

```bash
pnpm dlx track-dev-time setup
```

**yarn**

```bash
yarn track-dev-time setup
```

This will:

- Update your package.json to run the tracker and dev server concurrently.
- Add .track-dev-time/ to your .gitignore to exclude session files from version control.

‚ÑπÔ∏è track-dev-time uses concurrently under the hood to run your server and tracker in parallel.
No need to install it manually ‚Äî it‚Äôs bundled with the CLI.

## How It Works

Once the package is installed and configured using the setup command, track-dev-time automatically hooks into your development workflow. Every time you run your project‚Äôs development script, time tracking is launched in parallel with your server.

## Connecting the CLI to the Dashboard

To enable synchronization between your local development sessions and the track-dev-time SaaS dashboard, you need to link your CLI installation to your account.

### Step 1: Get your API key

<ApiKeyForm />

### Step 2: Authenticate the CLI

In your terminal, run the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
track-dev-time auth --apikey <yourApiKey>
```

The API key is stored globally on your computer. Each time a session needs to be
sent, the CLI will check the stored API key automatically.

## Using the CLI before signing up for the SaaS

If you use the track-dev-time CLI locally before registering on the dashboard, you can still synchronize your projects and sessions later. Run the following command inside each tracked project:

```bash
track-dev-time sync
```
