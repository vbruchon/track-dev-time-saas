# Documentation

track-dev-time is a comprehensive tool designed to automatically track your development sessions and provide insightful analytics via a powerful SaaS dashboard.

## Introduction

track-dev-time combines a seamless CLI experience with a cloud-based dashboard to help developers monitor their coding habits effortlessly.

- **Automatic Session Tracking:** As soon as you start your development environment (e.g., `npm run dev`), the CLI automatically tracks your coding sessions without any manual input.
- **Smart Session Management:** It handles starting, pausing, and stopping sessions based on your development workflow.
- **Data Synchronization & Analytics:** Session data is saved locally and synchronized with the SaaS platform, where you can view detailed statistics, trends, and motivational insights to improve your productivity.

This tool is ideal for developers looking to understand how they spend their time coding, identify productivity patterns, and stay motivated through personalized goals and analytics.

## Features

- Automatic session tracking on dev server start
- Intelligent session pause/resume management
- Local JSON session storage with automatic sync to SaaS
- Secure API key authentication
- Cross-project synchronization
- Dashboard with insights, trends, and motivational goals

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- An active internet connection to sync data with the SaaS dashboard

### Installing the CLI

You can install **track-dev-time** using any of the following package managers:

**npm**

```bash
  npm install track-dev-time --save-dev
```

**pnpm**

```bash
  pnpm add -D track-dev-time
```

**yarn**

```bash
  yarn add track-dev-time --dev
```

### Setup

Once installed, run the setup command to automatically configure your project:

**npm**

```bash
  npx track-dev-time setup
```

**pnpm**

```bash
pnpm dlx track-dev-time setup
```

**yarn**

```bash
yarn track-dev-time setup
```

This will:

- Automatically create a .track-dev-time/config.json file with default configuration values.
- Update your package.json to run the tracker and dev server concurrently.
- Add .track-dev-time/ to your .gitignore to exclude session files from version control.
- Prompt you to install concurrently if it‚Äôs not already installed.

‚ÑπÔ∏è To enable automatic tracking while your dev server is running, your project must run both tasks in parallel (dev server + tracker).  
`track-dev-time` recommends using [`concurrently`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) for this purpose.

During setup, the CLI will detect if `concurrently` is installed and offer to install it automatically if it‚Äôs missing.

You're free to use any other process runner (like `npm-run-all`, `turbo`, etc.), but you‚Äôll need to set it up manually to ensure the tracker and your server run together.

### Configuration File

The config file is located in the hidden folder `.track-dev-time` at your project root:
`.track-dev-time/config.json`

### Default Content

On first run or when executing the `setup` command, a `config.json` file is automatically created with the following default values:

```json
{
  "inactivityTimeoutMs": 900000,
  "autoResumeSessionWindowMs": 300000
}
```

- **inactivityTimeoutMs**: Inactivity timeout in milliseconds before the session is automatically paused. Default is 900,000 ms = 15 minutes.
- **autoResumeSessionWindowMs**: Time window in milliseconds to automatically resume a previous session if restarted within this delay. Default is 300,000 ms = 5 minutes.

### Modifying the Configuration

You can modify these values by manually editing the config.json file with your favorite text editor.

For example, to reduce the inactivity timeout to 5 minutes, update the file as follows:

```json
{
  "inactivityTimeoutMs": 300000,
  "autoResumeSessionWindowMs": 300000
}
```

### Applying Changes

New values will be applied as soon as the CLI reads the config file again, typically on start or when running commands.

### How It Works

Once the package is installed and configured using the setup command, track-dev-time automatically hooks into your development workflow. Every time you run your project‚Äôs development script, time tracking is launched in parallel with your server.

## Connecting the CLI to the Dashboard

To enable synchronization between your local development sessions and the track-dev-time SaaS dashboard, you need to link your CLI installation to your account.

### Step 1: Get your API key

<ApiKeyForm />

### Step 2: Authenticate the CLI

In your terminal, run the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
track-dev-time auth --apikey <yourApiKey>
```

The API key is stored globally on your computer. Each time a session needs to be
sent, the CLI will check the stored API key automatically.

## Using the CLI before signing up for the SaaS

If you use the track-dev-time CLI locally before registering on the dashboard, you can still synchronize your projects and sessions later. Run the following command inside each tracked project:

```bash
track-dev-time sync
```
