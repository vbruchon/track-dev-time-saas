We received a request to change the email address for your Track Dev Time account to: ${newEmail}.

If you made this request, please confirm it by clicking the link below:

${url}

If you did not request this change, you can safely ignore this email â€” your email address will remain unchanged.

Thanks,  
The Track Dev Time Team
